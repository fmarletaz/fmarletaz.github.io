After long efforts, our updated assembly of amphioxus [has been published in Nature Ecol. Evol.](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-020-1156-z) in collaboration with Dan Rokhsar and Oleg Simakov. The paper a huge leap forward in trying to resolve the sequence of chromosomal events that lead to vertebrate karyotypes and to evaluate the impact of whole genome duplication on chromosmal architecture.
