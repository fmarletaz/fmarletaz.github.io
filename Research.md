# Chaetognaths
These minute marine predators constitute one of the most enigmatic animal phyla.  I started working with them during my PhD, attempting to resolve their phylogenetic position using genomic data. We showed that they exhibit a mixture of very original characters, both an morphological and genomic levels, that coudl be reminiscent of the bilaterian ancestor.  I am now attempting to sequence and comparatively analyse their genome, but also to conduce some gene expression work to investigate their original embryology. I am also interested in their high polymorphism and its impact on genome regulation.
