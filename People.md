</div>
Ferdinand is supported by Royal Society University Research Fellowship.  His main research question focuses on the relationship between the diversity of genome organisations, the regulation of developmental gene expression and the evolution of animal body plans. He received his BSc and MSc at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon and his Phd from the University of Marseille. His Phd work was focused on the enigmatic phylum of chaetoganths.  He was a postdoctoral researcher with Pr. Peter Holland in Oxford where he started his work on whole genome duplications in vertebrates and he later moved to Japan in the unit of Pr. Daniel Rokhsar at the Okinawa Institute of Science & Technology. In 2020, he joined the GEE department at UCL to start his research group.

### Élise Parey
Élise started a postdoc in the lab in 2022, primarily focused on the evolution of echinoderm regulatory architecture. She is  supported by a [Newton International Fellowship](https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/). Previously, she conducted her PhD research in the ENS in Paris with [Hugues Roest-Crollius](https://www.ibens.ens.fr/?rubrique43&lang=en) and [Camille Berthelot](https://research.pasteur.fr/en/member/camille-berthelot/) on the evolution of fish genomes and the impact of whole genome duplication on chromosomal organisation.

### Omar Matar 
Omar joined the lab as a PhD student in 2022 to work on a regulatory analysis of the metamorphosis in sea urchin. Before that, he completed a undergraduate degree in molecular biotechnology at the University of Heidelberg gaining insight into cancer biology, neurodegeneration and developmental biology during his research. During his time in Heidelberg he joined Aissam Ikmi research group at EMBL focusing on tentacle tip regeneration in *Nematostella*. In 2021 he completed his Master of Science in Pharmaceutical Formulation and Entrepreneurship at UCL working on Nerve Wrap formulation for nerve crush injurie, local immunosuppression for the transplantation of engineered neural tissue to bridge nerve transections.

###  Laura Piovani 

Laura is a postdoctoral researcher working on single-cell and spatial transcriptomics approaches to understand the echinoderm bodyplan.  She graduated from the University of Milano and received her PhD from UCL in 2021. She is fascinated by the diversity and evolution of marine larva and how to use single-cell sequencing to understand the relationshipsof larval cell-types and the origin of animal life cycles. Laura is also an avid climber, diver, base jumper and a proud member of the [North London Moutainering Club](http://www.nlmc.co.uk).
