His main research question focuses on the relationship between the diversity of genome organisations, the regulation of developmental gene expression and the evolution of animal body plans. He received his BSc and MSc at the Ecole Normale Supérieure de Lyon and his Phd from the University of Marseille. His Phd work was focused on the enigmatic phylum of chaetoganths. He was a postdoctoral researcher with Pr. Peter Holland in Oxford where he started his work on whole genome duplications in vertebrates and he later moved to Japan in the unit of Pr. Daniel Rokhsar at the Okinawa Institute of Science &amp; Technology. In 2020, he joined the GEE department at UCL to start his research group. <br><br><br></p> <div style="float: right;padding-left:10px"> <img align="left" width="180" height="172" src="/assets/elise.jpeg"> </div> <h3 id="elise-parey">Elise Parey</h3> <p>Elise started as a postdoc in the lab in 2022, primarily focused on the evolution of echinoderm regulatory architecture. <a href="https://royalsociety.org/grants-schemes-awards/grants/newton-international/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newton International Fellowship</a>.
